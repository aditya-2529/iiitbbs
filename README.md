We are a team of researchers and engineers who are passionate about using technology to improve people's lives. We believe that everyone should have access to high-quality healthcare, regardless of their income or location. That's why we are developing a web application that uses machine learning to analyze images of specific body parts or medical conditions and provide information on possible diseases or conditions, along with general suggestions for remedies and advice.
